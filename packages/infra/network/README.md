# Network Infrastructure Module

This package provides infrastructure as code (IaC) components for managing cloud networking resources, including VPCs, subnets, routing, and security groups. It is designed for modular, scalable, and secure cloud-native environments.

## Architecture

- **Cloud-Native:** Built for AWS and Kubernetes networking best practices.
- **Modular:** Integrates with other infra modules (EKS, ArgoCD, database, etc.).
- **Secure:** Emphasizes least-privilege and network segmentation.

## Features

- Automated VPC and subnet provisioning
- Configurable routing and security groups
- Supports multi-environment deployments
- Integrates with other infrastructure modules

## Usage

1. Add this module as a dependency in your infrastructure project.
2. Configure networking parameters as needed.
3. Deploy using your preferred IaC tool.

## Requirements

- AWS account
- Node.js & pnpm (for development)
- AWS CLI (for cloud deployments)
